#Node.js Forum
Node.js needed a fun forum app with some new flashy technology. So here's my go at making a forum that takes advantage of Node.js w/ Hapi.js, Socket.IO and uses Bootstrap for it's UI. I've got awhile to go, but if you're interested in contributing shoot me a pull request. Fundamentals, and coding practices you will see in this project will be a little mix of a couple different Styles, however I do tend to be fairly consistant and I will work on documenting this project much better.

##Todos
Well, there's a lot of them -- I am working on currently migrating a lot of my Express.js libraries to Hapi.js (hapi'er this way). With that I have a whole pile of work ahead of me.  

- Implement OAuth, most likely will use Travelogue
- Mongoose general CRUD
- Slug generation
- Views: Create, Edit, View
- Add 'middleware' to link the forums with topics
